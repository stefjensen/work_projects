Two bash scripts to create a custom IGV track for both the NCBI's RefSeq and GENCODE's Ensembl databases. 
These scripts generate two *.BED files each: one whole genome *.BED file and an Avenio subset (from a list of gene symbols).

Most input files are readily available online but there may be a couple of bed files generated from the UCSC genome table that will need to be manually downloaded.

MANE select tracks are in purple for both RefSeq and Ensembl.
